# DJ requests

This application aims to solve an age old problem for DJs - handling music requests.

Most DJs are busy enough trying to make everybody dance. Many therefore deny any music requests,
and thus seem like a douche to the people asking. Listen to all requests, and you won't have time
to actually play music.

**DJ Requests** gives DJs a solution to this problem. The app gives a DJ an online request list,
which they can ask their dancing patrons to access and submit their requests. The lists will be saved,
so any DJ can go back and see the request history, including statistics.

The application is currently in the very early stages of development, so nothing is publicly available yet.
Hopefully, I'll have something up and working in just a few days time.

## About

**DJ Requests** is a project developed by me personally, in order to deal with a problem I'm facing as a DJ.
It's fun to open source stuff like this, and make it publicly available.

## Development

To help with development, clone the repository and install the dependencies
with `npm install`.

Once the dependencies are downloaded, you have a few tasks available:

```bash
$ npm start         # start the server
$ npm run watch     # re-build the front-end on code change
$ npm run dist      # build the front-end code for production
```
