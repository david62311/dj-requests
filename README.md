# DJ requests

This application aims to solve an age old problem for DJs - handling music requests. 

Most DJs are busy enough trying to make everybody dance. Many therefore deny any music requests, 
and thus seem like a douche to the people asking. Listen to all requests, and you won't have time 
to actually play music.

**DJ Requests** gives DJs a solution to this problem. The app gives a DJ an online request list, 
which they can ask their dancing patrons to access and submit their requests. The lists will be saved,
so any DJ can go back and see the request history, including statistics.

The application is currently in the very early stages of development, so nothing is publicly available yet. 
Hopefully, I'll have something up and working in just a few days time. 

## About

**DJ Requests** is a project developed by me personally, in order to deal with a problem I'm facing as a DJ. 
It's fun to open source stuff like this, and make it publicly available. 

This app is developed in an agile sense. As soon as I finish a feature, it will be pushed into production. 

## Current features

There are currently no features implemented. 

Since this project is built using an agile development methodology, you'll hopefully see this list grow in the future.

If you want to submit a feature request, simply create an issue here on Github.
